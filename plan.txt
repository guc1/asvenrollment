To meet your needs for a cost-effective and functional web app where users can create accounts, select a plan, input URLs, and have the Python script handle their requests, I recommend using a combination of open-source technologies and affordable cloud services. Here’s a precise list of the steps, tools, and platforms you should use:

1. Backend Framework: Flask (Python)

	•	Why: Flask is lightweight, easy to learn, and free (open-source). It’s perfect for building small to medium-sized applications with minimal overhead.
	•	What to Do: Set up a Flask app to handle user registration, login, and interaction with your Python script (for handling URLs).
	•	Additional Tools: Use Flask-Login for handling user authentication (login, logout, and session management).

2. Frontend: HTML/CSS + Bootstrap

	•	Why: Bootstrap is open-source and makes it easy to build a simple, responsive design without writing too much custom CSS.
	•	What to Do: Create basic forms for login, registration, and URL submission using HTML/CSS with Bootstrap. Bootstrap will help you create a modern design without having to focus too much on the UI.

3. Database: PostgreSQL

	•	Why: PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database that integrates well with Flask and handles all the user data, subscription information, and URL records.
	•	What to Do: Set up a PostgreSQL database to store user accounts, plan selections, and user-provided URLs. You can either host this locally (for development) or use a managed service for production.
	•	Free Option: Use the free-tier plan on Heroku PostgreSQL for small-scale apps.

4. Payment Integration: Stripe

	•	Why: Stripe is free to integrate and only charges per transaction. It’s simple to set up and handles subscription payments (like your $5/month plan) with ease.
	•	What to Do: Use Stripe’s Python SDK to handle payment processing and subscription management. Stripe handles the complexity of payments, making it easier to manage without building everything from scratch.

5. Task Scheduling and Execution: Celery + Redis

	•	Why: Celery is an open-source distributed task queue that can handle background tasks (e.g., running the Python script for multiple users simultaneously). Redis is used as a broker to manage the Celery tasks.
	•	What to Do: Integrate Celery with Flask to handle user-submitted URLs and execute Python scripts at the right time. You can schedule tasks with precise timing for enrollments using APScheduler or Celery’s internal task scheduling.
	•	Redis is open-source and can be run on a small instance (e.g., on DigitalOcean) or even hosted for free in development environments.

6. Authentication and Authorization: Flask-Login

	•	Why: Flask-Login is a lightweight open-source library that integrates with Flask to handle user sessions, logins, and logouts.
	•	What to Do: Implement Flask-Login to manage user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and submit their enrollment URLs.

7. Hosting: Heroku or DigitalOcean

	•	Why: Both Heroku and DigitalOcean offer low-cost hosting solutions with easy scaling for your app.
	•	Heroku: Offers a free tier that can handle small-scale apps like yours. You can host the Flask app, PostgreSQL database, and even Redis (for Celery).
	•	DigitalOcean: For as low as $5/month, you can get a droplet (virtual server) that will host your Flask app, Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL.
	•	What to Do: Choose one of these platforms:
	•	Heroku: For simplicity, it offers managed services (easy deployment, databases, task queues) with minimal setup. Start with the free tier and upgrade if necessary.
	•	DigitalOcean: Gives you more control over the server. If you’re comfortable with basic server management (SSH, configuring Python environments), it’s a great option. You’ll need to set up and manage your app manually but with more flexibility.

8. SSL for Security: Let’s Encrypt

	•	Why: Let’s Encrypt provides free SSL certificates, ensuring that your app is secure and uses HTTPS.
	•	What to Do: Integrate SSL via Let’s Encrypt either on Heroku (via an add-on) or DigitalOcean (by configuring it directly on your droplet).

9. Precise Scheduling: APScheduler or Celery’s Scheduled Tasks

	•	Why: You’ll need precise timing to ensure users are enrolled in their classes at the right moment. APScheduler can be used to run tasks at scheduled times, and Celery can handle distributed tasks concurrently.
	•	What to Do: Set up APScheduler to monitor user-submitted URLs and schedule the Celery task to enroll users at the exact time.

Step-by-Step Execution Plan

1. Set Up Flask App

	•	Create your Flask project directory.
	•	Install Flask and other dependencies via pip (e.g., Flask-Login, Flask-SQLAlchemy).
	•	Create routes for:
	•	User registration (/register)
	•	User login (/login)
	•	URL submission (/submit-url)

2. Set Up Database

	•	Set up PostgreSQL locally for development.
	•	Define models for users (with username, email, password, etc.) and URL submissions.
	•	For deployment, use Heroku PostgreSQL (free tier) or set up a small instance on DigitalOcean.

3. Add Payment Integration

	•	Register on Stripe and create a test account.
	•	Use Stripe’s Python SDK to handle subscription payments, implementing:
	•	A payment page where users can enter card details.
	•	Subscription logic for different plans (e.g., $5/month).

4. Set Up Celery and Redis

	•	Install and configure Celery to handle background tasks.
	•	Set up Redis (as the Celery message broker) either on Heroku or DigitalOcean.
	•	Define a Celery task that:
	•	Processes the URL submission.
	•	Runs the Python enrollment script when the time is right.

5. Deploy to Heroku or DigitalOcean

	•	If using Heroku:
	•	Push your app to Heroku using Git.
	•	Add PostgreSQL, Redis, and Stripe integrations using add-ons.
	•	If using DigitalOcean:
	•	Spin up a droplet, set up your server, and install the necessary tools (Python, PostgreSQL, Redis).
	•	Deploy the Flask app using Gunicorn and configure it with NGINX for better performance.

6. Set Up SSL (Let’s Encrypt)

	•	Follow the guides on Heroku or DigitalOcean to set up SSL using Let’s Encrypt for free.

7. Testing and Launch

	•	Test the entire flow: user registration, login, subscription, and URL submission.
	•	Ensure the Python script runs as expected when enrollment time approaches.
